# Formula 1 Data Analysis Project üèéÔ∏è

### Project Overview

This is my first data analysis project as I begin exploring data analysis with Python! As a big fan of Formula 1, I wanted to dive into F1 race data to compare the performance of two drivers, **Verstappen** and **Hamilton**, in a specific race. This project allowed me to practise fundamental Python skills, data cleaning, visualisation, and interpretation in a real-world sports context. The plan is to do more data analysis within the Formula 1 space and unearth interesting insights. 

### Motivation

With my love for F1 and interest in data, I chose this project to make my first data analysis experience engaging and challenging. This analysis helps me build practical skills in data handling and visualisation as I start my journey in data analysis.

### Data Source

The project uses data from the [FastF1 library](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/), which provides access to various Formula 1 race metrics, including lap times, sector times, and driver positions.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Using FastF1 to load race data, handle missing values, and format lap and sector times.
2. **Analysis and Summary Metrics**:
   - Calculating key performance metrics, such as average lap times, sector times, and net position changes for each driver.
3. **Visualisations**:
   - Creating visual comparisons of both drivers‚Äô lap times, sector times, and race positions over time.
4. **Conclusion and Insights**:
   - Summarising the drivers' performance differences based on the analysis.

### Key Findings

- **Lap Times**: Verstappen showed slightly faster and more consistent lap times compared to Hamilton across the race.
- **Sector Performance**: Verstappen recorded faster times in each sector, particularly in Sector 2.
- **Position Changes**: Hamilton gained positions throughout the race
